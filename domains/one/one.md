* Timing can be important - End of month, end of quarter. Based on pickup schedule.
* Protect trash - locks on dumpsters, shred confidential documents. Governments burn documents.

#### Shoulder surfing

<img class="subdo-img" src="../../assets/images/1.1/img4.png" width="250" height="auto">

* This is a social engineering attack in which the attackers obtain confidential information by looking over someone's shoulder to read what is on their computer screen or phone or to observe what they are typing.
* Can be in public areas such as airports and coffee shops.
* Can be done from afar using binoculars or through monitoring webcams.
* Prevent by using privacy filters, keep monitor out of sight, and be aware of your surroundings.

#### Pharming

* Traffic redirection to a Web site that looks identical to the intended website in order to capture the victim's PII/login credentials.
* Difficult for anti-malware to stop as everything seems legit for the unsuspecting users.
* Can use poisoned DNS server or client vulnerabilities.

#### Tailgating

<img class="subdo-img" src="../../assets/images/1.1/img5.png" width="250" height="auto">

* Gaining unauthorized access to restricted areas by following another person.

<img class="subdo-img" src="../../assets/images/1.1/img7.png" width="250" height="auto">

* When an attacker sends a fake invoice to a business for something such as a domain renewal, toner cartridges, etc., and states the invoice is from the CEO. The business may pay the invoice since it looks like it is coming from a legitimate source.
* Invoice looks like a legitimate one requesting printing services, lawn work, etc.
* Might also include a link to make the payment which the attacker can use to gain payment details.

<img class="subdo-img" src="../../assets/images/1.1/img8.png" width="250" height="auto">

* Gathering information on a victim. Gathers background information to build a believable pretext.

#### Hoax

* A threat that does not actually exist, is often in the form of an email, and still often consumes excessive resources.
* Hoax is often spread through email or social media.
* Some will take your money or waste as much time investigating it as if it were a legitimate issue.
* Spam filters can help
* Cross reference with others de-hoax sources such as hoax-slayer.net.

* A malicious attack that is directed toward a small group of specific individuals who visit the same website.

#### Typosquating

* A type of URL hijacking where there is a site with URLs that are slightly different from a legitimate source.

<img class="subdo-img" src="../../assets/images/1.1/img10.png" width="250" height="auto">

#### Pretexting

* A social engineering tactic that involves creating a false pretext or scenario to trick someone into divulging sensitive information.
