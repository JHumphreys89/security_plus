_Explain the importance of security concepts in an enterprise environment._

_Terms_: 30

***

#### Configuration Management

* Only constant is change - OS, patches, app updates, network modifications, etc.
* Identify and document hardware and software changes. Manage the security when changes occur.
* Rebuild systems in the event a disaster occurs; documentation and processes will be critical.

##### Diagrams

* Includes network diagrams to document the physical wire and device.
* Physical data center layout which can include physical rack locations.
* Device diagrams such as individual cabling.

##### Baseline Configuration

* Provide known, secure starting points for systems.
* Security for an app environment should be well defined:
     - All instances must follow this baseline.
     - Firewall settings, patch levels, OS file versions.
     - May require constant updates.
* Integrity measurements check for secure baseline, should be performed often, check against well-documented baselines and failures require immediate correction.

##### Standard Naming Conventions

* Create a standard which needs to be easily understood by everyone.
* For devices:
     - Asset tag names and numbers.
     - Computer names including location or region.
     - Serial numbers.
* Networks - use port labeling.
* For domain configs have user account names and standard email addresses.
