# Subdomain 2.1

_Explain the importance of security concepts in an enterprise environment._

_Terms_: 30

***

#### Configuration Management

* Only constant is change - OS, patches, app updates, network modifications, etc.
* Identify and document hardware and software changes. Manage the security when changes occur.
* Rebuild systems in the event a disaster occurs; documentation and processes will be critical.

##### Diagrams

* Includes network diagrams to document the physical wire and device.
* Physical data center layout which can include physical rack locations.
* Device diagrams such as individual cabling.

##### Baseline Configuration

* Provide known, secure starting points for systems.
* Security for an app environment should be well defined:
     - All instances must follow this baseline.
     - Firewall settings, patch levels, OS file versions.
     - May require constant updates.
* Integrity measurements check for secure baseline, should be performed often, check against well-documented baselines and failures require immediate correction.

##### Standard Naming Conventions

* Create a standard which needs to be easily understood by everyone.
* For devices:
     - Asset tag names and numbers.
     - Computer names including location or region.
     - Serial numbers.
* Networks - use port labeling.
* For domain configs have user account names and standard email addresses.

##### Internet Protocol (IP) Schema

* An IP address plan or model which helps avoid duplicate IP addressing and provides consistent addressing for network devices.
* Locations: number of subnets, hosts per subnet.
* IP ranges: different sites have a different subnet - 10.1.x.x/24, 10.2.x.x/24, 10.3.x.x/24.
* Reserved addresses for things such as users, printers, routers/default gateways.

#### Data Sovereignty

* Data that resides in a country is subject to the laws of said country. i.e. legal monitoring, court orders, etc.
* Laws may prohibit where data is stored such as data collected on EU citizens must be stored in the EU. GDPR (General Protection Regulation).
* Where is your data stored? Your compliance laws may prohibit moving data out of the country.

#### Data Protection

_Refers to the measures taken to safeguard data from unauthorized access, theft, corruption, or loss._

##### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

* Controls use of removable media. 
* Examines outgoing data and detects unauthorized data transfers.

##### Masking

* Data obfuscation - hide some of the original data.
* Protects PII and other sensitive data.
* The data may still be intact in storage and may only be hidden from view. Control the view based on permissions.
* Can include many different techniques such as substituting, shuffling, encrypting, masking out, etc.

##### Encryption

* Encode info into unreadable data. Original information is plaintext, encrypted form is ciphertext.
* This is a two way street; convert between one and the other if you have the proper key.
* Confusion - the encrypted data is drastically different than the plaintext.
* Diffusion - Change one character of the input, and many characters change of the output.

##### At Rest

* The data is on a storage device such as a hard drive, SSD, flash drive, etc.
* Encrypt the data with whole disk encryption, database encryption, or file- or folder-level encryption.
* Apply permissions with access control lists. Only authorized users can access the data.

##### In Transit/Motion

* Data transmitted over the network - also called data in-motion.
* Not much protection **_as it travels_**... many different switches, routers, devices.
* Network based protection such as firewall and IPS.
* Provide transport encryption with TLS (Transport Layer Security) and IPsec (Internet Protocol Security.)

##### In Processing

* Data in-use. Data is actively processing in memory - system RAM, CPU registers and cache.
* The data is almost always decrypted otherwise you couldn't do anything with it.
* The attackers can pick the decrypted information out of RAM - a very attractive option.

##### Tokenization

* Replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder - SSN 123-45-6789 is now 652-46-7742.
* Common with credit card processing (chip).
* This is **not** encryption or hashing. The original data and token are not mathematically related and no encryption overhead.

##### Rights Management

* Information Rights Management (IRM). Control how data is used - Microsoft Office documents, email messages, PDFs.
* Restrict data access to unauthorized persons. Prevent copy and paste, control screenshots, manage printing, restrict editing, etc.
* Each user has their own set of rights. Attackers have limited options.

#### Geographical Considerations

*  Legal implications:
     - Business regulations vary between states.
     - For recovery sites outside of the country, personnel must have a passport and be able to clear immigration.
     - Refer to your legal team.
* Offsite backup - Org-owned site or 3rd-party secure facility.
* Offsite recovery - hosted in a different location outside the scope of the disaster. Travel considerations for support staff an employees.

#### Response and Recovery Controls

* Incident response and recovery is commonplace and attacks are frequent and complex.
* Incident response plans should be established. Documentation is critical. Identify and contain the attack.
* Limit the impact of the attacker(s) and limit exfiltration as well as access to sensitive data.

#### Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) Inspection

* Relies on trust.
* Browser contains a list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). Doesn't trust a website unless a CA has signed the webserver's encryption certificate - the website pays some money to the CA for this.
* The CA has ostensibly performed some checks - validated against the DNS record, phone call, etc.
* Browser checks the webserver's CA and if it is signed by a trusted CA then the encryption works seamlessly.

#### Hashing

* Represent data as a short string of text - a message digest.
* One-way trip. Impossible to recover the original message from the digest. Used to store passwords/confidentiality.
* Verify a downloaded document is the same as the original - integrity.
* Can be a digital signature - authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity.
* Will not have a collision as different messages will not have the same hash.

#### API Considerations

* API = Application Programming Interface. Control software or hardware programmatically.
* Secure and harden the login page and don't forget about the API.
* On-path attack - intercept and modify API messages, replay API commands.
* API Injection - inject data into an API message.
* DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) - one bad API call can bring down a system.
* Security:
     - Authentication - Limit API access to legit users and over secure protocols.
     - Authorization - API should not allow extended access. Each user has a limited role. A read-only user should not be able to make any sort of changes.
     - WAF (Web Application Firewall) - apply rules to API communication.

#### Site Resiliency

_Achieved by using a recovery site, an alternative location that can take over after a disaster._

##### Hot Site

* Most expensive to maintain.
* An exact replica stocked with hardware that is constantly updated; you are essentially buying two of everything.
* Essentially flip a switch and everything moves to this alternative site.

##### Cold Site

* Least expensive to maintain.
* No hardware, just an empty building.
* No data - you bring this with you.
* No people - you are bussing in your team.

##### Warm Site

* Somewhere between hot and cold - just enough to get going.
* Big room with rack space - you bring the hardware.
* Hardware is ready and waiting - you bring the software and data.

#### Deception and Disruption

_Security concepts that can be used in an enterprise environment to detect and prevent cyberattacks._

* Deception - Involves creating a fake environment that is designed to lure attackers into revealing their presence and intentions.
* Disruption - On the other hand, involves taking steps to prevent attackers from carrying out their intended actions.

##### Honeypots

* Attract the bad guys and trap them there - A less secure server intended to attract attackers. Also used to observe attacker movements.
* The attacker is probably a machine - makes for interesting recon.
* Many different options such as Kippo, Google Hack Honeypot, Wordpot, etc.

##### Honeyfiles

* Bait for the honeypot (passwords.txt) ðŸ˜Ž
* An alert is set if the file is accessed. A virtual bear trap.

##### Honeynets

* Essentially, more than one honeypot on a network.
* More than one source of information.
* Stop spammers - https://projecthoneypot.org

##### Fake Telemetry

* Corrupts the data sent to monitoring systems and can cause disruption.
* Machine learning - interpret data to identify the invisible.
* Train the machine with actual data - learn how malware looks and acts. Stop malware based on actions instead of signatures.
* Send the machine learning model fake telemetry - make malicious malware look benign.

##### DNS Sinkhole

* DNS that hands out incorrect IP addresses - blackhole DNS.
* An attacker can redirect users to a malicious site.
* Can also redirect known malicious domains to a benign IP address. Watch for any users hitting that IP address. Those devices are infect.
* Can be integrated into a firewall. Identify infected devices not directly connected.
